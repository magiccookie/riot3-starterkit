# Riot 3 Starterkit

With this starterkit we want to provide **a simple foundation for Riot applications**. We are using the riot router and a flux inspired event controller called RiotControl.<br />
If you have any ideas on how to improve/simplify the structure you are welcome to help us.

This starterkit is based on:

* [Riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/)
* [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl/)
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

We are also using the following postcss plugins to process the CSS:

* [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
* [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)
* [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties)
* [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* [csswring](https://github.com/hail2u/node-csswring)


## Get the kit

```
$ git clone git@github.com:wbkd/riotjs-startkit.git && cd riotjs-startkit
```

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Development

```
$ npm run dev
```

Now the server is runnning on localhost:1337


## Build

```
$ npm run build
```



Thanks to https://github.com/txchen/feplay/tree/gh-pages/riot_webpack for a lot of concepts on how to structure the app.
